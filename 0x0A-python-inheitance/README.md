<h2>Requirements</h2>

<h3>Python Scripts</h3>
<ul>
   <li>Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
   <li>All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
   <li>All your files should end with a new line
   <li>The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
   <li>A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
   <li>Your code should use the pycodestyle
   <li>All your files must be executable
   <li>The length of your files will be tested using wc
<ul>
<h3>Python Test Cases</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
  <li>All your files should end with a new line
  <li>All your test files should be inside a folder tests
  <li>All your test files should be text files (extension: .txt)
  <li>All your tests should be executed by using this command: python3 -m doctest ./tests/*
  <li>All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
  <li>All your classes should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')
  <li>All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')
  <li>A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
  <li>We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases, so that you don’t miss any edge case
<ul>
<h2>Documentation</h2>
<li>Do not use the works import or from inside your comments, the checker will think you try to import some modules
