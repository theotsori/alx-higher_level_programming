<h1>JavaScript objects</h1>
<img src="https://fireship.io/courses/javascript/img/js-object-props.png">
<p>JavaScript is a programming language that supports object-oriented programming. Objects in JavaScript are collections of key-value pairs and can be created using object literals, constructor functions, or classes. Object properties can be accessed using dot notation or bracket notation.</p>
<p>JavaScript has function-level scope, which means that variables declared inside a function are only accessible within that function. However, JavaScript also has lexical scoping, which means that inner functions can access variables from outer functions, creating closures. Closures are functions that have access to variables from their outer scope, even after the outer function has returned.</p>
<p>Closures are often used in JavaScript to create private variables and functions. Private variables and functions can only be accessed within the closure and are not accessible from outside. This can be useful for creating modules and preventing naming collisions in large codebases.</p>
<p>Understanding objects, scopes, and closures in JavaScript is essential for writing maintainable and scalable code. By using objects to organize and encapsulate data, scopes to control variable visibility and lifetime, and closures to create private variables and functions, developers can write more robust and secure JavaScript applications.</p>
