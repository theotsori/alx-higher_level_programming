<p>JavaScript web scraping is a technique used to extract data from websites by automating the process of browsing and parsing web pages. The process involves using JavaScript to automate a web browser to simulate human interaction, such as clicking on links and submitting forms, and then extracting the relevant data from the resulting web pages. The extracted data can then be used for various purposes, such as data analysis, research, or creating custom applications.</p>
<p>To perform web scraping in JavaScript, developers can use various libraries such as Puppeteer, Cheerio, and Nightmare. These libraries provide APIs to control the browser, select and manipulate HTML elements, and extract data. The process of web scraping can be complex, and developers need to be mindful of the legal and ethical implications of web scraping, such as respecting the website's terms of service and not infringing on intellectual property rights. Overall, JavaScript web scraping is a powerful tool for data extraction and analysis, but it should be used responsibly and ethically.</p>
