<p>SQL stands for Structured Query Language and is used to communicate with relational databases. It is a standard programming language designed for managing and manipulating data stored in a database.</p>

<p>SQL is commonly used to create, read, update, and delete data in a database. Some common operations performed using SQL include selecting specific data, sorting and grouping data, creating tables and indexes, and defining relationships between tables.</p>

<p>SQL syntax is relatively easy to learn and understand, and many relational database management systems, such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle, use SQL as their primary programming language.</p>

<p>SQL commands can be executed using a command-line interface, graphical user interface, or by embedding SQL statements into other programming languages such as Java or Python. The use of SQL has become ubiquitous in the tech industry, and it is an essential skill for anyone working with databases.</p>
