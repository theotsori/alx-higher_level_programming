<p>JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic, and interpreted programming language that is widely used for web development. It is a client-side scripting language that runs in web browsers and enables interactive and responsive user interfaces. It was originally created by Brendan Eich at Netscape in 1995, and since then has become one of the most popular programming languages in the world.

JavaScript is used to add interactivity to web pages, create browser-based games, build web applications, and develop server-side applications with Node.js. It supports a range of programming paradigms including object-oriented, functional, and procedural styles. It is also often used in conjunction with HTML and CSS to create dynamic web pages and web applications.</p>
